NAME

    Text::Pluralize - simple pluralization routine

DESCRIPTION

    Text::Pluralize provides a lightweight routine to produce the proper form, 
    singular or plural, of a word or phrase. Its intended purpose is to produce 
    messages for the user, whether error messages or informational messages, 
    without the awkward "1 file(s) copied" appearance.

EXAMPLES

    In each of the examples below, the first column represents the template, the
    second column the count, and the third column the result.
