NAME

    Text::Pluralize - simple pluralization routine

SYNOPSIS

    use Text::Pluralize;

    print pluralize("file", $count);
    print pluralize("%d file(s) copied\n"), $count;
    print pluralize("There (was|were) {no|one|%d} error(s)\n", $count);

DESCRIPTION

Text::Pluralize provides a lightweight routine to produce the proper form,
singular or plural, of a word or phrase. Its intended purpose is to produce
messages for the user, whether error messages or informational messages, without
the awkward "1 file(s) copied" appearance.

EXAMPLES

In each of the examples below, the first column represents the template, the
second column the count, and the third column the result.
